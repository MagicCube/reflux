# reflux
A simple version of Redux-like single data flow library.
I tried to re-make Redux based on my understanding of its concept, without looking at any of its source codes in advance.
Although it is a simple implementation, it did pass most of the test cases of the original Redux.

**HAVE FUN TO RE-INVENT WHEELS.**
